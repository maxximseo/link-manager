INSTALLATION STEPS
------------------

1. UPLOAD THE FILE
   - Upload link-manager-widget.php to your website's root directory
   - Example: /public_html/link-manager-widget.php
   - Or any directory: /public_html/includes/link-manager-widget.php


2. ADD INCLUDE CODE
   - Open your website's index.php (or any PHP file where you want links)
   - Add this line where you want the links to appear:

   <?php include 'link-manager-widget.php'; ?>

   - If you placed the file in a subdirectory:

   <?php include 'includes/link-manager-widget.php'; ?>


3. REGISTER YOUR DOMAIN
   - Go to Link Manager dashboard: https://shark-app-9kv6u.ondigitalocean.app
   - Navigate to "Sites" section
   - Click "Add New Site"
   - Select site type: "Static PHP Site"
   - Enter your domain (e.g., example.com)
   - Click "Save"


4. PURCHASE LINKS
   - Go to "Placements" section
   - Select your site from the list
   - Choose links to place
   - Complete purchase
   - Links will appear on your site within 5 minutes (cache refresh)


CUSTOMIZATION (OPTIONAL)
-------------------------

Default styling is minimal. You can add custom CSS:

.link-manager-widget {
    margin: 20px 0;
    padding: 15px;
    background: #f5f5f5;
    border-radius: 5px;
}

.lm-links-list {
    list-style: none;
    padding: 0;
    margin: 0;
}

.lm-link-item {
    margin: 8px 0;
}

.lm-link-item a {
    color: #0066cc;
    text-decoration: none;
}

.lm-link-item a:hover {
    text-decoration: underline;
}


FEATURES
--------
✓ Automatic domain detection
✓ 5-minute caching (reduces server load)
✓ XSS protection built-in
✓ Silent failure (no errors shown to visitors)
✓ No configuration needed
✓ Works with any PHP framework


CACHING
-------
- Links are cached for 5 minutes in your system temp directory
- Cache directory: /tmp/link-manager-cache/ (Linux/Mac)
- Cache directory: C:\Windows\Temp\link-manager-cache\ (Windows)
- To force refresh: delete cache files or wait 5 minutes


TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

Q: Links not showing up?
A: Check:
   1. PHP file is properly included
   2. Domain is registered in Link Manager as "Static PHP Site"
   3. You have purchased links for this site
   4. Cache has refreshed (wait 5 minutes)

Q: How to verify widget is loaded?
A: View page source and search for "link-manager-widget"

Q: How to clear cache manually?
A: Delete files in /tmp/link-manager-cache/ directory

Q: Widget slows down page load?
A: Enable caching on your server. Widget caches API responses
   for 5 minutes, so it only makes 1 request per 5 minutes.


SECURITY
--------
- All URLs are validated and sanitized
- XSS protection on all output
- Only http:// and https:// protocols allowed
- Domain validation prevents injection attacks
- Cached data is stored securely with MD5 hashing
